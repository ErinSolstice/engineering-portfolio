			<p>Cervical collars are neck braces used for suspected spinal trauma and for post-surgical stabilization of the spine. Current cervical collars allow too much freedom of movement and have limited options for an individualized fit. I am using granular jamming and 3-D printing to resolve those problems. Granular jamming occurs when granular media, like coffee grounds, are placed under vacuum and become hard and rigid; by contrast, when not under vacuum, the bladder can be molded to the patient’s neck.</p>

					<figcaption><i>Figure 2: 3-D printed shell laid flat.</i></figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The previous prototype uses channels cut into a flat print at varying angles and spacing to allow the collar to fold up into a complex 3-D shape rather than a simple cone or cylinder. I used a 3-D scan of a person’s head, neck, and shoulders to create the initial 3-D part. Then, using Solidworks tools and a VBA script, I was able to flatten the collar into a printable shape. I placed in the top 10 engineering projects at LSU’s Discover Day of Spring 2021 with that design.</p>

			<p>The next iteration involves cutting out the middle section of the 3-D printed shell to create two rings. These rings will then be connected by adjustable length struts to form a Stewart’s platform. This allows complete control of the rings position relative to each other. The nitrile rubber bladders fill the space between the collar and the neck</p>

			<p>As part of a class project for Sophomore Design, my team did a teardown of a blender. For our report, we created Solidworks models of the most interesting components. Presented here are two of the drawings that I did for the brush assembly of the DC motor of the blender.</p>

		<h3 style="text-align: center"><a id="rimblownflute"></a>Anasazi Style Rim Blown Flute</h3>
			<p>My goal with this project was to design, build, and learn to play a rim-blown flute based on the Anasazi flutes found in the American Southwest. The original idea sprung from a chance encounter with whistles made from elderberry wood which led down a rabbit hole into full blown flute making.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>Hollowing out the elderberry branch was relatively simple as the center is a soft pith. However, before I could tune a rim-blown flute, I first needed to teach myself how to play one. I had played the viola for several years but had never played a wind instrument.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>Based on a small initial prototype, I found the higher notes easier to produce. So, I made several intermediate-sized prototypes as I experimented with hole placement and worked on developing my embouchure. After a swap in playing styles from vertical to oblique and many hours of practice, I managed to reliably produce the root note of the flute I wanted to make my final product. For the hole placement on the final flute, I used modified ratios of hole placement to flute length of the flutes found by archeologists in broken flute cave.</p>

			<p>After about 5-6 months of research, prototyping, and testing, I had a rim-blown flute that I could play reasonably well. And, while not perfectly in tune, it had recognizable intervals and a good sound.

		<h3 style="text-align: center"><a id="filterpress"></a>Filter Press Project Updated Version (W.R. Grace)</h3>
			<p>The plates of the filter press were undergoing significant warping resulting in poor filtering, bypass, and leakage.  Filter press plates should not need to be regularly replaced, but they were replacing the entire set every 3-5 months for ~$12,000 each time.</p>

					<figcaption><i>Figure 12: Cake material from filter press with high liquid content..</i></figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Examining the filter press manual thoroughly, I discovered that toluene, one of the process chemicals, was listed as chemically incompatible with the polypropylene plates. Consultation with the manufacturer indicated that the toluene in the slurry was likely chemically attacking the polypropylene plates and causing them to soften and warp; then, uneven cake buildup started occurring which accelerated the process.  Fortunately, the plates could be made from alternative materials such as PVDF and Glass Filled Nylon.</p>
			<p>My supervisor was considering purchasing one each of the PVDF and GF Nylon plates to test them out.  I pointed out that the rest of the plates would still warp and then allow uneven cake buildup.  As such, it wouldn’t be an accurate test of the chemical compatibility of the plates. I also noted that a chemical resistance chart showed that GF Nylon is rated slightly better than PVDF for exposure to toluene</p>
			<p>At the end of my internship, I wrote a 7-page memo detailing the entire process of troubleshooting the filter press.  The following were the next steps that I laid out in the memo.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Perform a more detailed economic analysis that includes labor costs. </li>
				<li>Scope out a capital project to purchase a complete set of GF Nylon plates. </li>
				<li>Establish a new protocol dictating when and how to clean the filter cloths and plates, and when to replace the cloths</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Based upon my recommendations, the company is planning to scope out a capital project to purchase a complete set of GF Nylon plates for ~$65,000 which is expected to result in annual savings of ~$27,000.</p>
