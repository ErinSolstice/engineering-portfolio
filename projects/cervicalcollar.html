        As a member of the LSU iCORE lab (Innovation in Control and Robotics Engineering), I’m responsible for a project that aims to radically redesign cervical collars to provide easy personalization of the fit for patients.  At LSU’s Discover Day 2021, I placed in the top 10 of the Engineering projects with my design combining granular jamming and 3-D printing of plastic shell prototypes.  Beyond providing a better, personalized fit for patients, the redesigned collars can be manufactured anywhere that coffee grounds (for the granular jamming pouches) and 3-D printers are available.
